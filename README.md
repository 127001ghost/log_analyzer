# Cowrie Log Analyzer
The purpose of this highly-personalized program is to parse cowrie events into digestable JSON files for fun and learning. The script is pretty slow when you get into very large log files. If the log file is over 100mb, it could take a few minutes (even without geolocation checking) on lesser hardware.

**WARNING** I'm not a python dev, this code follows no best practices and I don't know what I'm doing lol. Suggestions, code reviews, and ideas are very welcome.
